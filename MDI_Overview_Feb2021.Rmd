## Computing Resources


#### Achievements
Georgetown scholars have used cloud computing to connect new forms of large-scale data to societal scale issues ranging from corruption in public-private partnerships to climate change to understanding civil service to global biodiversity. Some projects have created databases that will become shared respositories for researchers  while others involve large-scale simulations.

#### Services
We provide access to cloud computing for faculty who need large-scale and fast computing resources.  Our services include compute clusters, large-scale databases including Postgres and BigQuery and access to statistical packages for large-scale data and private cloud-based storage. 

We will be increasing our services next year to include creation of data portals and data labeling services using Mechanical Turk.

#### Contacts

## Federal Statistical Research Data Center 

#### Achievements
The FSRDC is open again!  Thanks to the Restarting Research protocols and collaboration between the McCourt School and Census Bureau, our approved researchers can safely and securely access restricted data.  The FSRDC has generated interest across area non-profits and institutions.  Scholars using our U.S. Census Bureau Research Data Center have produced multiple working papers and journal articles. 

#### Services
MDI provides access to non-public U.S. Census data at our secure on-sight U.S. Census Research Data Center.  We support researchers by helping them learn about what data is available, apply for access and, if approved, to access the data.  Executive Director Amy O'Hara serves on the FSRDC Technical Committee and on the FSRDC Budget Committee.  She also works with the Census Bureau to streamline data request processes and improve linkage methods.

#### Contact

## Social Media Data Portals

We have developed four portals to date: election 2020, covid-19, and parenting. These portals are controlled by research teams, but allow for construction of variables from socail media and newspaper data through easy to use forms. It is particularly valuable for those with limited large-scale data programming skills. 

#### Services
MDI is developing a service that will give researchers access to variables constructed from the Twitter decahose. 

#### Contact
If you would like more information accessing social media data, please contact Lisa Singh (MDI Research Professor).

## Data curation

#### Achievements
We have developed efficient approaches for storing and processing these large-scale data sets. Currently, we have eight projects that are curating different social media and newspaper data sets. 

#### Services
MDI can provide scholars with access to certain specific data sets.  One is a large scale database of more than 700 million publicly available, open-source media articles and blog posts actively compiled since 2006 from a wide range of non-English sources.  Another is a very large data set of anonymized credit information.

MDI also makes available [administrative data metadata](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/research-data-center/administrative-data-metadata/) obtained through data use agreements with federal and state agencies which show the specific data elements shared with the census in order to improve research designs and increase the specificity of proposals.

We are also exploring whether we can assist in other data access projects.
